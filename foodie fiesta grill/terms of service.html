      <h1>  Guidelines & Restrictions<br>for the Use  Foodie Fiesta Grill <br>Trademarks and Logos</h1>
        The Foodie Fiesta Grill trademarks, service marks, logos, and copyrights (collectively, “Marks”) are important assets to
        the company and represent the brand quality and consistency that we have developed with our guests over the
        course of many years. We ask journalists, press agencies, educational outlets, students and other media
        organizations who would like to use the Burger King Marks in connection with news stories and reports to observe
        the following guidelines and restrictions: The Marks may not be copied or distributed apart from the applicable
        article or broadcast. You may not redistribute the Marks in hard copy or electronic form for others to use or
        copy. You may not modify the form, color or design of any Marks. You may not animate or otherwise distort the
        appearance of any Marks. You may not cut off or cover up any portion of the Marks. The Marks must stand alone
        and should not be combined with any other logos, elements or designs.When using the Marks in publications that
        will be distributed only in the United States, include the appropriate trademark symbol (® or TM as applicable)
        following the first or most prominent use.Use the correct generic name or descriptor immediately following the
        first mention of the Mark in text (such as “Whopper sandwich”).If using Marks in publications that will be
        distributed outside the United States, do not include trademark symbols. Instead, use an appropriate trademark
        attribution notice, for example: Foodie Fiesta Grill and HOME OF THE WHOPPER are trademarks of Burger King Company LLC,
        registered in the U.S. and other countries.
